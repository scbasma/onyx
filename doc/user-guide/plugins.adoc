== Plugins

Plugins serve as an abstract to compose mechanisms for getting data in
and out of Onyx. See the README.md of the project for a list of official
Onyx plugins, or keep reading to roll your own.

=== Interfaces

In order to implement a plugin, one or more protocols need to be
implemented from the https://github.com/onyx-platform/onyx/blob/0.10.x/src/onyx/plugin/protocols.clj[plugin interfaces].

==== Input Plugin

Required interface implementations:

* Plugin (stop/start)
* Input
* Checkpointed
* BarrierSynchronization

==== Output Plugin

Required interface implementations:

* Plugin (stop/start)
* Output
* Checkpointed
* BarrierSynchronization

=== Templates

To help move past the boilerplate of creating new plugins, use Leiningen
with https://github.com/onyx-platform/onyx-plugin[`onyx-plugin`] to
generate a template.
